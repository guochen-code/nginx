a certificate revocation lsit (CRL) is a list of digital certificates 
that have been revoked by the issuing certifficate authority 
before their schedule expiration date and shouuld no longer be trusted

before client trusts the website, it will check if site's certificate is on the CRL

# example why on CRL: breach of private key, compromised, revoke current cerificate

problem above, client needs to look through the CRL, if what you are looking for is the last one in the list,
it will take some amount of time, not efficient

the online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is an internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation 
status of an X.509 digital certificate
OSCP is realsed to an alternative to CRL
instead of searching through the list, the client sent a request to authority server to verify if it is revoked and get a response from the server.

*************revocation
certbot revoke --cert-path <cert-path> --key-path <key-path>
# you can find the paths in:
cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# when you visit the website
-> secure connection failed. .... certificate has been revoked.....

# after revoked, use different browser, chrome, you can still open the website, why?
firefox make use of OCSP
chrome does not make use of OCSP
goodle chrome has its own methods for checking revoked certificate called CRLSets

with this, it maintains its own list of CRL's which is collected from certificate authorities

this means that the browser doesnot need to contact the Certificate Authority itself and removes the performance and privacy overheads.
