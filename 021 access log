information about client request in the access log after the request is processed

(1) client request (2) server response (200, 404, 500...) all write into access log

ll /var/log/nginx -> access.log error.log

#open access log
less /var/log/nginx/access.log
# you find
ip address/request/browser/operating system version/ 
(it is pre-determined log format you configured in nginx.conf - http block - log_format)

*************** how to customize

under http block:

log_format main '$remote_addr - ..............
log_format master "$remote_addr" - "$status";

access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main; # where you want to store the log # main is used to match if you have multiple log formats defined

# downside:
if host multiple websites on a single server
if use master, all websites will log using master log format
niginx allows us to have the flexibility to use different log formats for different websites

# how to:
nano web.conf

server {
  server_name example.com
  access_log /var/log/nginx/example.log main # /var/log/nginx/example.log - where to store; main - log format
  ....
}

ll /var/log/nginx ->
access.log
error.log
example.log
