default is round-robin
2 servers, requests will be evenly distributed to each server

but sometimes it is not efficient, for instance:

server 1 has big PHP, which takes 20 seconds to execute
server 2 has small PHP, which takes 1 second to execute
request A to server 1 and request B to server, what about request C. It should go to server 2 because server 1 is busy

how to configure:

(1) nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/web.conf
upstream backend {
  least conn;
  server 52.4.121.83;
  server 52.3.20.56'
}

(2) open access.log to see how many requests come to each server
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

(3) send requests: ab -n 20 -c 10 52.6.237.228/
