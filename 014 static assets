client -> reversed proxy -> web server
700 requests from clients to reversed proxy
700 requests again from reversed proxy to web server

so store static files in the reversed proxy to reduce the requests made to the web server !
better performance and overall response time back to client will be fast!

************************* how to configure reverse proxy with static assets

-- in reverse proxy server:
nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/kp.conf

server {
  server_name kp.in;
  
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://192.168.189.139; # pass to upstream server
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
  }
}

-- in upstream server:
nano etc/nginx/conf.d/kap.conf

server {
  server_name kp.in;
  
  location / {
    root /var/www/websites/kp;
}

ls -l /var/www/websites/kp -> shows all website files such as css, php, html, js and img etc...  # we can move these files to the reverse proxy !!!!!!!!!!!

cd /var/log/nginx/
ls -> access.log error.log
# let's empty all of them, so it is clear to see what will happen next....
echo > access.log
echo > error.log

# too see all the logs at one time
tail -f * # you will see to load a webpage, there are so many requests in this upstream server.....that's why we can move the files to the reverse proxy !!!!!!!!

# you need to copy the entire folder to the reverse proxy, once done
nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/kp.conf

server {
  server_name kp.in;
  
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://192.168.189.139; # pass to upstream server
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
  }
  
  location ~ * \.(css|js|jpe?g|JPG|png) {
    root /var/www/assests;
    try_files $uri $ $uri/;
  }
  
}

mkdir /var/wwww/assets
cp -R css/ img/ js/ master/ vendor/ /var/www/assets/ # copy and move to /var/www/assets/

# so dynamic files will be fetched from the upstream server while the static files will be fechted from local assets from proxy server

niginx -t # testing new configuration
service nginx reload

# now we are done, we can see the logs again
in upstream server:
cd /var/log/nginx/
ls -> access.log error.log
# let's empty all of them, so it is clear to see what will happen next....
echo > access.log
echo > error.log

# remove the static files
cd /var/www/websites/kp
rm -rf css/ img/ js/ master/

cd /var.log/nginx/
tail -f * -> will see the amount of requests reduced significantly !!!!!!!
