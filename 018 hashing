assume you have a document that is named as document
# how to get the hash of the document when you in the document folder
md5sum document

# hashing help us identify if a file is modified or not
# because even if you change one small thing in the file, the hash will be totally different.
# application: in production environment, for all important files, there will be a program monitoring if these files are modified or not
# if modification detected, it will notify the administrator

**** encryption vs hashing
encryption is a 2 way function
plain text -> use key -> encrypted text -> use key -> plain text

hashing is a 1 way function
plain text -> use hashing algorithm -> hashed values
# you will not be able to recover the plain text 

USE of Hashing
1) your system files do not change. if changed, then there is high probability that Virus has done it.
2) you can store passwords in Hashed Value instead of Encrypted Value.
3) verify the integrity of software that you download

case 2):
there must be a place where user name and password are stored to verify.
if data are stored in plain text data, dangerous
1) encryption: secret key has to be stored somewhere. If scret key is leaked, all the data are leaked
2) hashing: send hashed value, and also store hashed value to verift with each other.
hashing is 1 way function, no way to recover the plain text, so even hacker gets hold of the data storage, cannot decode.
# user name usually does not be hashed, only hash password. both user name and hashed value matched, correct credential

use case #2:
assume you are downloading a software, the hacker can block your download and insert its own version in the communication channel
so in general, the server will give a hash value of the software
client computer will verify the hash value.
if hash value changed, 2 possibilities
(1) not downloading correctly, some portion of the software must have been crrupted
(2) from the network, there has been some modification that has been done to the file





always check the hash value when you downloading your file.
