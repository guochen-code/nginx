unequal distribution of traffic
server weight allows us to customize the request flow between Nginx acting as a load balancer to the upstream backends.

sample configuration:
upstream backend {
  server 10.139.0.3;
  server 10.139.0.4 weight=2; # 2 requests will come here while 1 request will go to the other
  
server {
  listen     80;
  .....
  }
}

where to find the configuration file:
cd /etc/nginx/conf.d/
nano load-balancer.conf

*********** for testing and see the results
(1) both in server 1 and server 2:
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

(2) load balancer server:
ab -n 10 localhost/

# you will see 3 requests went to server 10.139.0.3 while 7 requests went to server 10.139.0.4
