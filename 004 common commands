nginx -v

-v: print version
-V: print version, compiler version and configure parameters
-t: don't run, just test the configuration file
-c: specify which configuration file NGINX should use instead of the default
-h: show help



********** include directives
include       conf.d/*.conf; # all files under conf.d ended with .conf will be included in the http section




********** show which port
netstat -ntlp

# default port is 80, but you can change it in the configuration file
# if changed, for example to 8080
# in your web browser, you should use https://50.16.46.226:8080 instead of https://50.16.46.226, which does not work anymore!
