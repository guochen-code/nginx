this is useful for servers which are providing download related content
example:
bandwidth of the server: 100 mbps
10 clients:
2: 50 mbps
8: 2 mbps
problem: 2 clients will use up all the 100 mbps server bandwidth
so it is import to limit the connection speed that you give to individual user

# test your machine downloading speed
wget http://cachefly.cachefly.net.100mb.test -> it shows 17.7 MB/s capability

# download a file
wget <file link url> -> 593KB/s -> it shows restricted downloading speed even though my intenet can go up to 17.7MB/s


************** how to configure in nigix
server {
  listen 80;
  location / {
    root  /var/www/websites/example;
    index index.html index.htm;
  }
  location /downloads {
    root /var/www/websites/example;
    limit_rate 50k;
  }
}

nginx -t
service nginx reload

# we are using server-b to download file from server-a
# what happen if we use server-b to download the file multiple times simualtenously (multiple connections from the same ip address)
it is ok, and each individual connection will be given downloading speed of 50k

# you can also limit the amount of connection of one ip address to 1
in example.conf file:

limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;

server {
  listen 80;
  location / {
    root  /var/www/websites/example;
    index index.html index.htm;
  }
  location /downloads {
    root /var/www/websites/example;
    limit_rate 50k;
    limit_conn addr 1;   # only allow 1 connection from one ip address
  }
}

Error 503: service temporarily unavailable.

********** another thing

in example.conf file:

limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;

server {
  listen 80;
  location / {
    root  /var/www/websites/example;
    index index.html index.htm;
  }
  location /downloads {
    root /var/www/websites/example;
    limit_rate_after 50m; # first 50m, allow user to download at full speed, then limit to 50K speed
    limit_rate 50k;
    limit_conn addr 1;   # only allow 1 connection from one ip address
  }
}
