what is the problem?
by default, the backeend server gets all the requests from Reverse Proxy server and all the access logs will have Nginx IP.
for many use-cases where binding needs to be done at Client IP level, this will be a problem.

the ideal way of doing things:
in this approach, you configure server in a way that the actual Client IP is logged in the access log file of the backend server.

2 important configuration
- reverse proxy : proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
- backend server : $http_x_real_ip;

*************************

Document - X-Real-IP Configuration
Reverse Proxy Side

nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy.conf

proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

Backend Server Side

nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

"$http_x_real_ip"
