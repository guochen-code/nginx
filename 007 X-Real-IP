what is the problem?
by default, the backeend server gets all the requests from Reverse Proxy server and all the access logs will have Nginx IP.
for many use-cases where binding needs to be done at Client IP level, this will be a problem.

the ideal way of doing things:
in this approach, you configure server in a way that the actual Client IP is logged in the access log file of the backend server.
