the default server blocks can be good enough for a single domain based website
for multiple domain based websites, we have to create multiple server blocks

(1) cd /etc/nginx/conf.d
(2) cat default.conf
(3) create a new file: nano kplabs.conf; copy and paste the existing server block from default.conf and 
                                                                                          made corresponding modifications such as server_name and location-root
  (a) create a new server block and in the server_name, you specify the new domain name: kplabs.internal
  (b) under location, refer to the new html folder: root /usr/share/nginx/html/kplabs;
                                                    index index.html index.html;
(4) cd /usr/share/nginx/html/
(5) create a new folder: mkdir kplabs
(6) cd kplabs
(7) nano index.html; type in "this is the kplabs website"
# up to now, cd /etc/nginx/conf.d/
# ls -> default.conf kplabs.conf
(8) nginx -t # test new confifuration

# what we want is that we want a request to go to the domain kplabs, but there is no public domain called kplabs available
# so we will need to modify the ETC host directly of the Linux server itself
# we will add a local host for the domain
(1) nano /etc/hosts
(2) add into the file and save: 127.0.0.1 kplabs.internal
# so basically, anytime we make a request to this domain kplabs.internal, it should be directed to this local host IP 127.0.0.1 which is the same server

curl localhost -> ok
curl kplabs.internal -> this is the kplabs website


*********************** set up loggoing
(1) nano kplabs.conf
(2) modify the file and save: access_log /var/log/nginx/kplabs.access.log main;
(3) systemctl restart nginx
(4) curl kplabs.internal -> this is the kplabs website.
(5) cd /var/log/nginx
(6) ls -> kplabs.access.log ..... and more.....
(7) cat kplabs.access.log
