asymmetric cryptography, uses public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data

one key in the pair can be shared with everyone; it is called the public key. the other key in the pair is kept secret; it is called the private key.

either of the keys can be used to encrypt a message; the opposite key from the one used to encrypt the message is used for decryption

# generate a public and private key
ssh-keygen
->
your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
your private key has been save in /root/.ssh/id_rsa

cd ~/.ssh
cat id_rsa.pub # see the key
cat id_rsa

********************************** application
whenever I log in through ssh

ssh -i ~/.ssh/dp_rsa root@139.59.30.228 # ~/.ssh/dp_rsa is where the private key is stored
# sometimes it will ask:
enter password # this is additional password to private key
