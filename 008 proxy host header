what is the problem?
by default, the host header that is received at the Reverse Proxy level is not forwarded to the backend server.

problem happens when?
if backend server is hosting application associated with multiple websites/domains, there is no way for it to know the original domain requested by the client.

1 important configuration
go to: nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy.conf
reverse proxy - proxy_set_header Host $host

************ to check details
in the application server: yum -y install tcpdump

in tmp folder: echo > headers # create a file called headers
run the command in the application server: tcpdump -A -vvvv -s 9999 -i eth1 port 80 > /tmp/headers # overwrite if run again.      # eth1 because of private ip

in the proxy server, run: curl kplabs.internal

back to application server, run: cat headers -> you can see in the file: Host: kplabs.internal

******************* example
proxy.conf ->
proxy_set_header Host $host;
  listen 80;
  server name localhost;
  
  location / {
      proxy_pass http://10.139.0.3;           # eth1 because of this private ip. If different ip, use different eth number !!!!!!
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;          # can be changed to "proxy_set_header Chen $host", will see corresponding change in: cat headers
    }
    location / admin {
        proxy_pass http://139.59.11.125;
      }
  }
