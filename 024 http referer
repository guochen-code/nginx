application:
you post your website on youtube and want to see how many visits are from youtube
you can search based on header http referer which indicates where the request comes from

server A have 1000 requests and server B which is hosting the images will also have 1000 requests, because images have to be loaded
so you may want to block if you are server B, prevent stealing bandwidth and resources.
