  location /friendly_404 {
    return 404 "sorry.";
  }

  location /greet {
    return 200 "hello user";
  }
}

167.99.93.26/nothing -> will go to friendly_404
why not /greet, because it is not under root folder
$uri is built-in uri
only the very last element cause the rewrite
all these before the last have nginx check relative to the root directory
which means /nothing will be rewritten to /friendly_404, re-evaluated and caught by the matching location
