nginx provides two default logs: access log and error log


# create a specifc log file to log specific location access history

location /secure {
  access_log /var/log/nginx/secure.access.log;
  return 200 "welcome to secure area.";
  }
}

if you want to log it in default access log

location /secure {
  access_log /var/log/nginx/secure.access.log;
  access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
  return 200 "welcome to secure area.";
  }
}

# for site receiving very high traffic, you can disable logging on it
location /secure {
  access_log off;
  return 200 "welcome to secure area.";
  }
}
