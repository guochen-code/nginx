importance of upstream block
upstream block can be used to specify the group of servers for which you want the load balanced traffic to be distributed.

sample configuration:

upstream backend {
  server 10.139.0.3;
  server 10.139.0.4;
}

server {
    listen    80;
    server_name localhost;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend'
  }
}

****************************
curl 10.139.0.3 -> this is server 02
curl 10.139.0.4 -> this is server 01

curl localhost -> this is server 02
curl localhost -> this is server 01 # localhost is the load balancer itself, 50% - 50% to each server
