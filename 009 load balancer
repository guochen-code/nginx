importance of upstream block
upstream block can be used to specify the group of servers for which you want the load balanced traffic to be distributed.

sample configuration:

upstream backend {
  server 10.139.0.3;
  server 10.139.0.4;
}

server {
    listen    80;
    server_name localhost;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend'
  }
}
