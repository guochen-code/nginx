unlike access, you don't have the flexibility to define the log format. It is pre-defined by nginx, you cannot change it

the only thing you can change is:
(1) level of logging
(2) where to store

#empty the logs
echo > /var/log/nginx//access.log
echo > /var/log/nginx/error.log

# open both
tail -f /var/log/nginx/*

level of logging:
example:
error: try to open an unexisting website
emergency: configuration failed, nginx not functioning properly

debug logs by default are not enabled. too much infomration.
