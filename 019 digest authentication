not supported in nginx, supported in apache server

why digest authentication?
H1(username+password+realm)
H2(uri+realm)
H1,H2+nounce
nouce is changing constantly over time to avoid replay attack

# verify if apache installed
rpm -qa | grep httpd

# in this case, we have both nginx and apache in a single server
# so need to stop nginx first, check if nginx is stopped
service nginx status
# check apache is running
service httpd status -> httpd(pid 3407) is running...

vim /etc/http/conf/httpd.conf
# search for /mod_auth
# you will find the second module is for digest authentication
# so make sure you have this module installed
